        Hello, my name is Jinze Mao. I am a senior from Michigan State University. My major is media and information. I come from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. I have a strong interest in ending problems, so I want to develop a website to help students solve their problems. Why should I design such a website? Because in the process of our study, we often encounter many problems. But it's very inefficient to rely on one's own ending or asking friends. So I want to design a website that can solve problems as quickly as possible and provide solutions. In this way, you can learn how to solve similar problems while seeing the answers. Homework help is not only a website to search for answers to questions, but also a learning website. My site is not like other homework sites, need to pay high fees, my site is completely free, the use of the method is very simple. So welcome to use, thank you very much. If you have any questions, please contact my email maojinze@msu.edu
